## It seems you just found your new automation buddy.

Bulo is a scalable solution to automate tasks at the organization level. The idea behind this project is to provide developers and business teams a unique platform to collaborate and bring value to the organization. 
No more duplicate work, everything here is built so the community can share solutions and leverage on existing work. From the scale of a team, to the entire Bulo's community.
As scalability is at the core of its design, Bulo can stretch from a simple standalone Desktop App to an entreprise-scale, microservices application.

## Which problems Bulo does solve?  

At the scale of a large organisation, it's pretty common to find duplicated code and projects across the business units. How common is it to scrap top tweets per criteria for community managers? All Banks traders need to watch quotes from Bloomberg to operate, 
and I presume that I was not the only one who had to send a daily CSV report by mail during my intership. 

In theory, communication is seamlessly performed at the management team level so duplicates are spotted and the workforce is used efficiently, no waste. In practice, Management role includes a bunch of responsibilities, which makes difficult if not impossible for executives to spend enough time on spotting inefficiencies.

**Bulo solves this** by providing a unique platform to gather all capacities built by your company's developers. No more duplicates, if you want to achieve something that _probably many people did before_, 
then just search for it on Bulo's store. With it's microservice architecture, Bulo is a scalable solution for your business to support any task that could be automated, and create wonderful tools that will help employees to focus on exciting and high-value, at any time.

Exclusively built in Java to achieve scalability up (microservices) and down (desktop standalone), Bulo aims to help Business and developer to collaborate in an efficient fashion, so will together achieve more with less efforts. 
With exclusive features as Functional Stages, Flows inter-communications, and integration with multiple languages (Beta roadmap -> Pyhton, Groovy, Java, and more in future versions) Bulo v1 is in the right position to bring your _digital transformation_ at the next level.

# Mocking Bird - Integration tests  

This module is used to test **uat** and **dev** environment by mimicking all users interactions.  
Useful to test the **microservices** mode application, as it's impossible 
to create component test for the cross-services features.  

### Get Started

Please go in test/ folder to find runnable elements. You have to start services manually,
